## Jigsaw

Jigsaw is a Cocoa [rtorrent](http://libtorrent.rakshasa.no/) UI, that connects via rtorrent's
native XMLRPC interface. I don't use rtorrent anymore, so this project is effectively abandoned
and hasn't been updated since 2010. It hasn't even been updated for XCode4.

You might well be better served by one of the [3rd party tools](http://libtorrent.rakshasa.no/wiki/UtilsList) listed on the [rtorrent wiki](http://libtorrent.rakshasa.no/wiki).
